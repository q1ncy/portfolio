    <h2>music in the making</h2>
    <img class="frank" src="img/frank.jpeg" height="69"> <p> For a good artist,the fundamentsla part of making music , mostly hiphop music is the beats.
        everything is aboy the beats!Other than lyrical talents, setting a right rythm might br the breaking point that separate <strong>whack artists</strong> from <strong>black artists</strong>
        As example lets look at the rythim talents of some of the most "iconic" artists of our generation
    </p>
    <div style="margin:1cm;">
 <h3>here are some of the most influential artists</h3>

    <h4>What we can learn from all these people </h4>
    <p class="faxx">Bassically what most of these artists showcase is the ability to create a <span style="color: coral">catchy</span>rythm to ingage the mind of the audince ergo 'compeling' them to frequent streamin.
    This isnt any form of <span style="font-style: italic">voodoo</span>but barely a wise play of basic human psycology.
    Recent studies have shown that the human mind can be easily manipulated by specific patterns of music which is a mild of oh hipnosis!
    Scientists have actually submited studies that the concept of complete hypnosis might be an actual possibility.
    But as it is human experimentation is actually an 'illegal' action in most vcountries if not all.
    In a remote city in the country of <srong>Kenya</srong> which goes by the alias <span style="font-style: italic;">Nakuru</span> a rogue clique of unemployed scientists have been reportedly
    trying human experimantation which has been romoured to be a succes.
    These methods are used to treat babric bahavious and by some to 'tame' their children and drive them to good behaviour</p>
