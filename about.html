    <h2>Eductional background</h2>
        <p>At the age of 14 i was done with my Primary level education at the <em>NEEC</em>
        institute in Nakuru.I further advanced on to Sacho High <span class="info">a school in the remote areas of Baringo county</span>
        Spending 4 years in the serene environments of Sacho surrounded with nature and blessed with beautiful sunsets, hepled me to figure out my life w/the aid of my teachers.
        It was at this place where i developed further interest in computers...<span class="info">mostly because i needed to pass my exams</span>
        (well the means dont justify the end do they?)
        At the age of 17 i was done with my time in High school and sat for my National examinations.
        And now here i am studying at <em>Moringa</em> barely a Year later.</p>
