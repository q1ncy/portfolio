          Aged 18 years old,I've grown an interest in the technology field and
          im lucky enough to have an opportunity to venture into my area of
          interest.As per of now i have no current engagements in my studies
          which compelled me to apply for this learning opportunity.
          <br />
          In doing this 3-months course, i tend to increase my knowledge and my
          technological skill-set for maybe future opportunities ,that is if i
          am accepted to the program.Increasing my current skill-set will aid in
          a further cause to aid in solving day to day problems in terms of
          technology,cyber security and basically making life easier and simpler
          for the human race. With my current level of experience and only a
          prep certificate from <em>Moringa School</em> boot camp i may not be
          the best candidate of choice, maybe because of my age and level of
          experience, all i have to offer on the table is my hard-work and
          determination to become the best version of myself.
          <br />

          <li>Ethical hacking(pen-testing)</li>
        </ul>
        The list may not be as extensive but its only the beginning God wiling
