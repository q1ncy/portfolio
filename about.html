    <p>Aged 17 year currently theres nothing pretty inetersing about my life.
        My life has been pretty much about learining.to simplify it heres a short list of the institutes ive learned in.
        <ul>
            <li>carol academy <em>pre-school</em></li>
            <li>NEEC Nakuru <em>primary-school</em></li>
            <li>Sacho high school <em>High-school</em></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="edits">
        <ol>
            <li>video games <em>COD mostly</em></li>
            <li>music <em>well most genres(except reggea)</em></li>
            <li>Films & art</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        Thats mostly what id like to do in my free days ,art has been a skillset im blessed with
        ,not only an eye for art but the craftsmanship itself.
        I made a descioin to join <strong>Moringa school</strong> in hope to improve my codig skills as
        ive always wanted to make digital art and coding will grant me w/the necessary skillset
